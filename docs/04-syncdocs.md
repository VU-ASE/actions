# Synching the Docs

Our docs have a synching mechanism that is defined in the `fetch-and-deploy` workflow. It means that the docs look into all the repositories we use and gathers the files in their `docs` directories. Then it shows their documentations on the official [ASE](https://ase.vu.nl/) website under the Framework/Software tab.

We have designed this in order to keep the documentation all in one place, making it easier for newcomers and maintainers to search up any information they might need regarding a library, service, embedded or the rover repositories.
